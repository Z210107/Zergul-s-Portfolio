                <p>The goal of this project is to create or improve a sleep tracking app that will help students improve their sleep habits using data from wearable devices. By focusing on sleep tracking, understanding students' mental sleep patterns, and applying behavioral change techniques, the app will help students develop more effective sleep routines. </p> 
                <p>The goal of this project is to help students improve their sleep with a sleep tracking app that works with smartwatches. The app will contain useful tips and reminders to help students sleep better.To understand the needs of the students, we talked to them (with 5 students) about their sleep problems and what they want to see in the sleep app. Based on this, we will develop a solution suitable for their lives.</p>

                <h3>Sleep Habits::</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using your phone late at night, especially on social media, is a common problem.</li>
                    <li>Most of the students said that their sleep schedule changes frequently. Sometimes they sleep for 7 hours, and sometimes only 3-4 hours.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Awareness of Sleep Trackers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some students are aware of sleep apps like Sleep Cycle, Meditopia, but only a few of them have used them.</li>
                    <li>Those who tried them abandoned them because the apps didn't help much or they didn't feel motivated.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>What Students Want:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The app shows how long and at what time they will sleep. It should also remind them to go to bed on time and give them advice on how to get a better night's sleep.</li>
                    <li>Students want the app to help them understand why they don't sleep well and offer solutions. Some also want fun features like rewards for a good night's sleep.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Concerns:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some worry that the app may display inaccurate sleep data.</li>
                    <li>Others are concerned about privacy and how their data will be used.</li>
                    <li>They also want the app to show real results, otherwise they won't keep using it.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Suggestions from Participants:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most students prefer a smartwatch because itâ€™s easy to wear and use.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Competitive Testing
            </h3> 
            <p>After evaluating similar applications, we made adjustments based on student preferences. For example, competing apps didn't have distractions like social media, which led to the addition of an app lock feature. This helps to avoid distractions during sleep. Users can set time limits for blocking applications, which helps them avoid the temptation to communicate on social networks. </p>
                
            <p>We also found that students wanted clear and actionable sleep improvement tips based on their habits, which led to the introduction of more meaningful AI-based feedback.</p>
           <p>The inclusion of push notifications for sleep reminders and easy-to-read schedules was also based on feedback that students prefer to interact in real time rather than just monitor the situation without useful information.</p>
